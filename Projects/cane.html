                    <h1>IMP Project (Design Thinking)</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the first semester this year, I had the opportunity to design a product that would be beneficial to the community. The product that our group came up with is a walking stick made specifically for the blind to cross gaps
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was a walking stick with a mechanism that allows the user to deploy and retract the extensions that allow them to cross gaps.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over the course of the module, we were are to put in our skills of design thinking to the test and improve on the design itself. We needed to
                        take into account multiple drawbacks of the cane as well as any critisism and suggestions from the lecturers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Moreover, we were also tasked to interviewee stakeholders who are the direct target of the cane and ask them for any problems or troubles they come
                        across with regards to the cane.
