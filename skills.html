                    <h2>1. Leadership (Core)</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of my most confident skills that I think I have is leadership. I was once the section leader of my club in Secondary School
                        so being exposed to a leading position is nothing new to me. I actively take part in activities and always care about the well being of my section.
                        I am also part of the band ExCo as a welfare leader and this has thought me how to lead a team in planning activities for the club and to
                        manage an important even such a farewell ceremony for seniors or an open-house performance for freshmens.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Coding (Technical)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coding is one my technical skills that I am confident in. I have undergone the course of Python, the image shown is the code of a game that I created, and I am currently learning programming in the languages of C#, HTML and Javascript.
                        In the future, I hope to hone in more on my skills as a developer since I am very interested in creating a game of my own.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. SYF 2019</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had the chance to represent my school at the 2019 SYF competition. It was one of my most memorable experience and it may be develop a lot as a person. It was the first ever major
                        performance that places us against other schools competiting for fame. It was an interesting experience since I was able to talk and interact with other
                        band members from other schools as well as to see the tiring days of our training pay off with the Ceritficate of Merit in SYF 2019.

                    <h2>3. Aikido Black Belt</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have undertaken Aikido as a side interest for over 8 years now, and recently I've obtained black belt and have became affliated with the dojo I'm with.
                        This is the video of my Black Belt examination. I believe martial arts to be something that teaches me self-disicpline and it also doubles as a method
                        of self-defense, you never know when you need it. If possible, I want to aim to be an instructor and teach others as well since I think Martial Arts is something
                        everyone should try.
                    </p>
