                    <h1>Gaming</h1>
                    <p>
                        I identify myself as someone who is quite into gaming. I just love the endless possibilities of creation. A few of my favourites games are all MMORPG oriented as I like interacting with others! 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The images shows a few of them!
                        These pictures are from Final Fantasy 14 which is one of my favourite games of all time!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Gaming is also one of the few driving reason as to why I wanted to pick up programing. Every game has a backbone and I want to see how it 
                        is created. I wanted to dive into the behind-the-scenes parts of a game and see how the developers built it from scratch. Someday, I hope to even build my own personal game.
